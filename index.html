						<h2>Why Muscat?</h2>
						<h3>Omani Capital with Ancient Forts and Emerald Beaches</h3>
						<p>
							Muscat, the capital of Oman, has served as an integral trading
							link between the east and the west and still remains a major stop
							for cruises and trade vessels. The city has maintained its old
							charm with even the newer structures having Arabian details. Not
							to mention the emerald blue beaches and exciting watersports that
							attract adventure enthusiasts. A city among the hills and beaches,
							this one is a must-visit for culture fanatics as well. In fact, it
							is the largest city and also happens to be the seat of the
							government.
						</p>
						<p>
							Muscat probably saw its first communal activities in the 6 BCE.
							However, over periods of time, it has been ruled by various
							indigenous tribes as well as major empires like the Persians,
							Portuguese and the Ottomans. In the 18th century when Muscat was a
							regional military power its influence was very widespread. In
							fact, it spread up to East Africa and Zanzibar. Ever since 1970
							Muscat has experienced rapid growth and modernisation.
